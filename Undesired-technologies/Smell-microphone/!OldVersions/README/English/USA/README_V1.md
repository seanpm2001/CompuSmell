## Smell microphone

**Description:** A device that takes smells/odor from one computer in one room, and transports them to another computer in another room (sometimes the same room) asking for this through a network connection.

**Priority information:** This is the lowest of priority for development, and is not necessary. It is already hard enough getting a computer to programmatically produce an order. Recording one would be a whole new challenge.
